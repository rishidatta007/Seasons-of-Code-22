# Seasons-of-Code-22
For the initial part of the project, I was asked to finish the course, " Introduction to Machine learning" offered by Standford University on Coursera.
It is a 12 week intensive course based on neural networks, linear regression, gradient descent, image classification on MNIST dataset and sub-topics.
There were many assignments done on Matlab and Octave.
Next I was ask to do an introductory course on python for data science on Udemy website.
It has broadly described how to initialize jupyter notebook, input commands, slicing operations on lists, basic and advanced operations on given data classes like lists, dataframes, array etc.
Finished specialization on deep learning provided by deeplearning.ai on Coursera by Prof.Andrew Ng.
